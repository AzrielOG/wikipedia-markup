    Succulent Plants
  </h1>
  <p style="color: wheat;">Succulents are special plants with thickened, fleshy parts like stems or leaves that store water, helping them survive in dry areas. The term comes from the Latin word for "juice" or "sap." They can have water content up to 90â€“95% in certain parts. Succulents thrive in hot, low-rainfall places like deserts but can also grow in rocky alpine areas. They don't form a specific plant group; instead, the term describes their water-retaining features. Some families have many succulent species, while others have few. Succulents, appreciated for their unique appearance, are often grown as ornamental plants, needing minimal care. Importantly, while all cacti are succulents, not all succulents are cacti.</p>

<ul>

  <ol style="list-style: decimal;">

  <li>Succulent plants are characterized by parts that are thickened, fleshy, and engorged, typically to retain water in arid climates or soil conditions.</li>
<br>
  <li>Succulents can store water in various structures such as leaves, stems, and sometimes roots. The water content of some succulent organs can be very high, reaching up to 90-95%.</li>
<br>
  <li>Succulents are often found in habitats with high temperatures and low rainfall, such as deserts. However, they can also be found in alpine ecosystems growing in rocky soil.</li>
